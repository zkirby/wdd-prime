HW 11 of WDD Sp18

# Purpose
Students pursing the 'advanced' JavaScript homework construct a client side server substitute for session/local storage 
for a small number of users. The students invent their own storage compression/JSON methods to store and pass between
the web pages of their app

Additionally, there is an example of an observer pattern.
